The goal of these measurements was to compare the results of the plugin's rendering with Matlab outputs for different RIRs

The RIRs were taken from a TU Berlin set of complex rooms. For each room a single scenario (listener position, source position) was selected (each time the source speaker was a dodecaedron) and in addition to the RIR the room geometry was extracted and fed into the Matlab code (slightly altered demo.m file).

Since the Matlab code always renders the first BRIR with the listener facing the source, the same Scenario was re-enacted in the Plugin. That means in addition to the psx_CRx.json loading the internal rotation matrix was actived and Yaw/Pitch were set to face the source ("Dir"). For example like that

Azimuth_Direct = 19.6 --> Yaw = -19.6
Elevation_Direct = -7.8 --> Pitch = 7.8

Extrapolated position in Matlab 		-1; 1; 0
(One to the back on X axis, One up on Y Axis)

Respective positional shift in JUCE 	-1;-1; 0
(One to the left on X Axis, One down on Y Axis)
