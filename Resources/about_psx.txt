brir.binNoise is stereo pink noise data for convolution of diffuse reverb
brir.binRev is binaural Reverb generated by synthBinRev.m 
- a weighting function, based on the specular part of the BRIR is applied upon loading of binRev

rir contains the monaural impulse response

spat.refListSpat contains the list of reflections (N=10)
- .AzEl_Direct = azi/ele of direct sound
- .e energy of 10 reflections
- .selectAzEl = azi/ele of 10 reflections
- .selectSE = start/end points (in samples) of 10 reflections
- .SE_Direct = start/end points (in samples) of direct sound in MIR
- .toa times of arival (in samples) of 10 reflections
--- Careful, in extrap there is another refListSpat refListSpat (for translated Listener Pos.)

- look at jsonDump.m, which was added to the ParaSpaX Matlab repo
