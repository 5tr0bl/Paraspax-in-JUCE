- go to ...\Spatial_Audio_Framework\scripts
- execute the two .bat (Batch-)scripts (both WITH ADMIN RIGHTS!!!)
-- for the mkl script use the "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022"
-- use the ones ending with "...oneAPI_2024.bat"

In the IPP .bat script
- when asked if something points to a file or a directory choose "directory"

In the MKL .bat script
- when asked for sequential or threaded, choose "sequential"
- when asked for lp64 or ilp64 configuration, choose "lp64" (the recommended 32-bit option)

NOTE:
- After the IPP/MKL setup it is already possible to load a pre-built version of the Plugin in Reaper
- without the custom libs Reaper fails to load the Plugin

Remember to alter the include and search paths in the Projucer File!
